About Speech Recognition : 

This brand new feature can solve equations based on your voice 

Prerequisites : 
1.Make sure you are connected to internet
2.Make sure your microphone is turned on
3.Make sure there no background voice

For 2 equation 2 variable  :-

Equation 1 - a1x + b1y = c1
Equation 2 - a2x + b2y = c2

Speak in the format - 

First equation A is "Your number" ,B is "Your number" , C is "Your number"
Second Equation A is "Your number" , B is "Your number" , C is "Your number"

For 3 equation 3 variable :- 

Equation 1 - a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
Equation 2 - a2x + b2y + c2z = d2
Equation 3 - a3x + b3y + c3z = d3

Speak in format of :- 

First equation A is "Your number" , B is "Your number" , C is "Your number" , D is "Your number"
Second Equation A is "Your number" , B is "Your number" , C is "Your number" , D is "Your number"
Third Equation A is "Your number" , B is "Your number" , C is "Your number" , D is "Your number"

Edit :- Speech recognition may take some time depending upon the clarity with which you speak
